## <u>**Motivation**</u>
Here is a list of my motivations for this project!

- learn how to properly use Node for generating a readme through command line operation
- 
- utilizing template literals to interpolate variables into strings
- lastly, I wanted to create a fully functioning readme generator that myself and anyone I know can use to effortlessly create a professional file.
