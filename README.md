# <u>**Week 9 Challenge**</u>
This weeks challenge focused on being able to use node.js to be able to create a command line app that will allow you to create a professional README.

## <u>**Motivation**</u>
Here is a list of my motivations for this project!

- learn how to properly use Node.js for generating a readme through command line operation
- utilizing template literals to interpolate variables into strings
- lastly, I wanted to create a fully functioning readme generator that myself and anyone I know can use to effortlessly create a professional file.
